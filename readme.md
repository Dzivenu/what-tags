# What Tags

A simple web app to show what tags a user uses, and the tags their followers use.

Requested by [(at)hexdek16](https://steemit.com/steemit/@hexdek16) on Steemit in [this post](https://steemit.com/steemit/@hexdek16/request-for-a-new-app-program-for-steemit).

> Could someone create an app that lets you know the tags your followers use or view. In creating content here on Steemit, I'd like to think followers follow me because they want to see content I create or Resteem. Yet, as more and more people follow me I'm unable to know what content my followers follow.

The project repository was started by @thrize AKA (at)personz on Steemit.

## There's nothing here yet!

That's right, the project is currently in **ideation**, no code has been written yet.

Please add suggestions, etc., as issues.
